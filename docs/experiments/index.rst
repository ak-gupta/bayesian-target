When should you use this package?
=================================

Check back later! I will be conducting several experiments using synthetic and
popular datasets to understand when (and if) this package offers a useful method
for encoding high cardinality nominal categorical data. Future experiments include

* How many categorical levels do you need before this becomes useful?
* Marginal bayesian target encoding: do you see lift if you use the output of an
  initial model with no categorical variables as the target for encoding?
* Using ensemble sampling vs using the mean of the posterior distribution: does it matter?
